# lexical-analyzer-react

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mazixiang/lexical-analyzer-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mazixiang/lexical-analyzer-react)

编译原理的期末项目实践，使用 `react` 构建的简易的词法分析器，演示效果如下

![demo](demo.gif)

想借此机会熟悉一下 `Travis CI`，这个运行默认的 `yarn test` 或者 `npm test` 是不行的，会出现 `TypeError`，说我的 `CodeFlaskReact` 中的 `CSS.support` 不是一个函数（不知道原因），所以我把 `script` 设置为 `npm build` 或者 `yarn build`，构建可以通过。

目前计划将这个集成到 `Electron` 框架中，来实现真正的应用程序

下面是 react 生成的官方文档

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
